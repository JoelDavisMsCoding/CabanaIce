<h2>Five Years Strong</h2>

 <div id="intro">
<p>
	We have been in business for five years now becoming more experienced by the day. We set our standards very high because we only believe in the best. In our five years we have served many in all type of enviorments and yet always had good compliments afterwards. Its not much we have not seen, so no matter what type of celebration it is we can handle it. Having that being said if you want to celebrate right its only one way to do it and thats with Cabana Shaved Ice.
